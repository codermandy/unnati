              gesture shown to us by his Excellency Mr. Rabie Narsh(Ambassador,

              Every mountain top is within reach if you just keep climbing.
              Scrambling the steep slopes and rattling over various cuts is not
              everyoneâ€™s cup of tea. Unnati salutes the audacity, wisdom and
              courage of our team member Nitish Singh on successfully conquering
              the Mt.Stok Kangri and hoisting Unnati's flag at the peak of Mt.
              Stok Kangri.

              It is said, "Kids saving the world > adults saving the world." It
              is important to inculcate the 'debate and discussion' culture in
              them. To do that MUN can be really helpful. Unnati organizes Model
              United Nations in different schools, our latest venture was
              organizing MUN at Evergreen Public School, Vasundhara Enclave
              where around 450 delegates form Dehi/NCR debated and discussed on
              various topics like sustainable development goals 2030 etc. Rabie
              Narsh, the ambassador of the republic of Lebanon and Naveen
              Sharma, President International Society for Cooperation and
              Development gave away the prize for the best delegate and the best
              speaker.
