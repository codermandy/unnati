              We are proud to announce that we have successfully conducted yet
              another astounding conference: UTHAN YOUTH PARLUAMENT CHAPTER 4;
              which was graced by the presence of honorable Ambassador Muhamed
              Cengic, a career diplomat with more than two decades of experience
              in the Bosnia and Herzegovina Foreign Service. Prior to his
              current assignment, he served as Ambassador of Bosnia and
              Herzegovina to the Republic of Indonesia, Republic of Singapore
              and DR Timor Leste. We are also gratified by the guests who showed
              up and blessed our occasion: P L Punia, Member of Parliament,
              Rajya Sabha; Ruchi Gupta, Joint Secretary, AICC; Varun Rajpal,
              Lawyer, High Court; Ashima Mandla, Lawyer, Supreme Court; Neeraj
              Kundan, National President, NSUI; Geeta Sahare, Deputy Dean,
              University of Delhi; Raman Besil, Founder, Langda Aam Productions;
              Naveen Sharma, President, International Society for Cooperation
              and development UTHAN was also the proud hosts of 800+ delegates
              and worked in collaboration with 40 institutions. We are highly
              blessed with love and support we have received over the past few
              months. The success of the conference belongs to the EBs, who
              enriched the level of debate; the hard working guests, who made
              time for us; the organising committee, who worked continuously for
              days and nights without any break; and most importantly the
              delegates, who researched with their heart and put their souls
              into the two days. We would like to show our gratitude towards the
              organising committee, without them hosting an event at such a
              grand level wouldn't have been possible. We held a highly fruitful
              debate on a vast diversity of topics which enriched the knowledge
              of our debaters, and will be helpful in their promising and bright
              future. UTHAN gave the young minds the opportunity to rack up
              their brain and speak in a loud and convincing manner. The
              delegates learnt to defend and counter attack their oppositions
              and geared then for the practical world.
